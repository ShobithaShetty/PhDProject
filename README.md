Main codes related to S-MESH framework for NO2, PM2.5 spatial prediction

This repository contains code references for S-MESH framework that performs ML based spatial prediction of NO2 and PM2.5 over Europe. The work forms a part of my
PhD project at NILU and University of Oslo, Norway with funding support from Norwegian Research Council under the grant agreement 321851.

A single day input dataset is uploaded as part of this code for those interested.
